    <p>Churchgoers are like coals in a fire. When they cling together, they keep the flame aglow; when they separate, they die out.
    Billy Graham
    
    
    A glorious Church is like a magnificent feast; there is all the variety that may be, but every one chooses out a dish or two that he likes, and lets the rest alone: how glorious soever the Church is, every one chooses out of it his own religion, by which he governs himself, and lets the rest alone.
    John Selden
